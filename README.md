# hMtools

`hMtools` - the toolbox you need to run most of Hendrik's Matlab code. A collection of more or less useful hFunctions to facilitate my workflow in signal processing and data visualization. Scarcely documented but heavily used over the past two decades.

### No guarantees whatsoever!
Only for my friends and friendly colleagues.
Use at your own risk!

*Please do not write your own hFunctions. Pick a different prefix letter, will you?!* ;-)

Cheers, Hendrik
